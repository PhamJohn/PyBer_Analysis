# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to use Pandas and Matplotlib where a multiple-line graph shows fares for each city type.


## Results:
Total Fares by City
* Urban: 62.7%, $39,854.38
* Suburban: 30.5%, $19,356.33
* Rural: 6.8%, $4,327.93

Total Rides by City Type
* Urban: 68.4.7%, 
* Suburban: 26.3%, 
* Rural: 5.3%, 

## Summary:
Rural has the lowest fare, then Suburban and finally Urban. Instinctively I would recommend Urban since this type is the highest, but there are factors to consider such as cost per fare, available equipment, and operators. Therefore more data is needed before choosing the type of fare.
